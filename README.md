# predicting_vc_with_neural_networks

This projects goal is to test several deep learning Neural networks in order to predict the success of 
venture capital investements.  

The analysis uses an Encoder, StandardScaler and train_test_split in order 
to preprocess the data.  Three neural network models are then tested to see if anyone of these models does a better
job at predicting the success of the venutre investment.
